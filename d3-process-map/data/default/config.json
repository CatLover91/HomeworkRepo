//config.json

//A JSON object which contains the following fields:

  //  title: The page title.
    //graph: The parameters for the graph and the d3.js force layout.
      //  linkDistance: The link distance for the d3.js force layout.
        //charge: The charge for the d3.js force layout.
//        height: The height of the graph, in pixels. (The width of the graph is determined by the width of the browser window when the page is loaded.)
  //      numColors: The number of colors to display (between 3 and 12).
    //    labelPadding: The padding inside the node rectangles, in pixels.
      //  labelMargin: The margin outside the node rectangles, in pixels.
//    types: Descriptions of the object types displayed in this graph, each with a long and a short field that describe the object type for documentation and for the graph legend, respectively.
  //  constraints: An array of objects that describe how to position the nodes. Each constraint should have a type field whose value should be either 'position' or 'linkStrength', and a has field that specifies the conditions an object must meet for the constraints to be applied.
    //    Position constraints: These constraints should have the properties weight, x (optional) and y (optional). On each iteration of the force layout, node positions will be "nudged" towards the x and/or y values given, with a force proportional to the weight given.
      //  Link strength constraints: These constraints should have the property strength, which is a multiplier on the link strength of the links to and from the objects that the constraint applies to. This can be used to relax the position of certain nodes.
